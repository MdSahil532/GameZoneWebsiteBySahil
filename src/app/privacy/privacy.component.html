                <p>Your privacy is very important to us. At GameZone.io we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
                    <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, or protect our rights.</li>
                    <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.</li>

                <h3 class="mb-3">Website Visitors</h3>
                <P>Like most website operators, GameZone.io collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GameZone.io’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GameZone’s visitors use its website.</P>
                <P>GameZone.io also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving reviews on our products. GameZone.io only discloses logged in user and reviewer IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that product reviewer IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the website where the review was left.</P>

                <h3 class="mb-3">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>Certain visitors to GameZone.io’s website choose to interact with GameZone.io in ways that require GameZone.io to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that DealStore.io gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who review on our products to provide a name and email address. Those who wish to receive DealStore.io updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, DealStore.io collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with GameZone.io. DealStore.io does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
