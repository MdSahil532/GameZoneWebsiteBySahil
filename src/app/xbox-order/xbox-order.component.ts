Unlike the first four mainline games, this is the first and so far only mainline game to receive a "Teen" rating from the ESRB.',

In the beginning of the game, players create their custom characters and choose from four classes, each of them has unique abilities that the players can utilize.[3] The four classes include the Trickster, which has the ability to manipulate time, the Pyromancer, which can manipulate fire, the Devastator, which can unleash seismic attacks, and the Technomancer, which uses turrets and other devices.[4] These special skills have a short cooldown time and can be combined with other skills for maximum effects. The game features a skill tree that allows players to unlock and upgrade their skills.The game incorporates various role-playing elements. As the players explore, they can explore different hub areas, talk to non-playable characters and complete side missions. In cutscenes a dialogue tree allows to decide the outcome of some conversations, though it does not affect the story\'s progression. The game can be played solo, but players can also complete the game together with two other players.',

      des: 'Star Wars: Squadrons is a space combat game, played from a first-person perspective. Players take control of starfighters from either the Galactic Empire or the New Republic navy. In these ships, they can utilise the movement of power between the ship\'s functions of weaponry, shields and engines to defeat their opponents in combat. Imperial starfighters do not have shields, resulting in other additions to their class so that the two teams would be balanced.[1] As players earn more experience, they can unlock new weapons, shields, upgrades and various cosmetic items for the pilot and their ship.[2] Completing Daily Challenges and Operation Challenges will also give players Glory, which can be spent on purchasing cosmetic unlocks.[3] Players can check the ship\'s status, shields and powers by viewing the instruments in the ship\'s cockpit.',
